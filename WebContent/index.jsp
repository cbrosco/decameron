<h1>GeoDecameron</h1>

<p class="descrip" >
	GeoDecameron is a website that allows academics to visualize the geographical movement 
	of the characters in the tales of the Boccaccio's Decameron. You can explore the geographic 
	reach of the Decameron. To what extent was Boccaccio a European thinker?
	What was Italys relation to Europe in his eyes? 
	
	</p>
	<p class= "descrip">
	<i>Search for a story by location, day or storyteller</i><br>
	<i>Or Select a specific story</i>
	
	</p>
	<p class= "descrip">
	Seeing, and comparing, the movement of the characters in each story shows a bigger picture 
	that you cannot get through just reading the stories individually.
	
		</p>
	<p class= "descrip">
	This provides a new, valuable mode of analysis for the Decameron.
